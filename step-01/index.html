      <li>
        <span>Affligem Blond</span>
        <p>Affligem Blonde, the classic clear blonde abbey ale, with a gentle roundness and 6.8% alcohol. Low on
          bitterness, it is eminently drinkable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Affligem Tripel</span>
        <p>The king of the abbey beers. It is amber-gold and pours with a deep head and original aroma, delivering a
          complex, full bodied flavour. Pure enjoyment! Secondary fermentation in the bottle.</p>
